# We use the special "key" argument to assign a fixed identity to this
# component instance. By default, when a component's arguments change,
# it is considered a new instance and will be re-mounted on the frontend
# and lose its current state. In this case, we want to vary the component's
# "name" argument without having it get recreated.
